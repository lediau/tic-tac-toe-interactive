# tic-tac-toe-interactive

[JetBrains Academy Project — challenging]

**Description:** Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing! In short it:
1. Prints an empty grid at the beginning of the game.
2. Creates a game loop where the program asks the user to enter the cell coordinates, analyzes the move for correctness and shows a grid with the changes if everything is okay.
3. Ends the game when someone wins or there is a draw.
